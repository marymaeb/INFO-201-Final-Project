of the victims of police shootings. The first panel displays a USmap which is colored according to the proportion of individuals
who were fatally shot by policemen and were mentally ill (out of all individuals shot). This map gave evidence to suggest
states in the north had higher proportions of mentally ill individuals who were victimized, while states in the south had
a smaller proportion. This evidence suggests that there is a disproportionate approach as to how US policing systems issue order
when confronting an individual with a mental illness. This suggests that nationwide training should be instilled in police forces
to detail how to respond to calls involving mentally ill individuals. It is then that we can hope to reduce these numbers.")
