fatal police shooting since Jan 1st 2015 to June 1st 2020. We found this located
on the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/police-deadly-force-usage-us/metadata)
and decided that this is what we wanted to focus on
energy on for the final project. This data can allow us to look at patterns
among fatal police shootings in the US and analysis thouse. This is important as, especially in the last couple
of years, the amount of fatal police shootings have been surronding the media. This
topic is one people should be paying attention to as we question: Should police
have the ability to be the jury, judge and executioner of US citzens? Should police being
killing people they vow to protect? Looking at this data we can find patterns and see
if the people being shot are putting the police in danger and demographic wise who is being shot
most. Using this data we can start answering those bigger questions such as; are these shootings justified?")

who were fatally shot by policemen and were mentally ill (out of all individuals shot). This map gave evidence to suggest
states in the north had higher proportions of mentally ill individuals who were victimized, while states in the south had
a smaller proportion. This evidence suggests that there is a disproportionate approach as to how US policing systems issue order
when confronting an individual with a mental illness. This suggests that nationwide training should be instilled in police forces
to detail how to respond to calls involving mentally ill individuals. It is then that we can hope to reduce these numbers.")
