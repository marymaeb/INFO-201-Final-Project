      energy on for the final project. This data can allow us to look at patterns 
      among fatal police shootings in the US and analysis thouse. This is important as, especially in the last couple
            of years, the amount of fatal police shootings have been surronding the media. This
            topic is one people should be paying attention to as we question: Should police 
            have the ability to be the jury, judge and executioner of US citzens? Should police being
            killing people they vow to protect? Looking at this data we can find patterns and see
            if the people being shot are putting the police in danger and demographic wise who is being shot
            most. Using this data we can start answering those bigger questions such as; are these shootings justified?")
